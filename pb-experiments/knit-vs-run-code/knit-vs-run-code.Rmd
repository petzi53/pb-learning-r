```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Goal of the Exerpiment

I want to see the differences between `knit` and `Run All` code.

## Setup

I will create two chunks:

1. The first one creates a variable `var1` and display it.
2. The second one uses the variable `var1`, creates a second variable `var2` and displays it.

## Procedures

1. Knit document without ever running any chunks.
2. Run first chunk and knit document.
3. Run second chunk and knit document.
4. Change first chunk and knit document.
5. Change first chunk again and "Run All".


```{r var1}
var1 <- 1 + 100
var1
```

```{r var2}
var2 <- var1 + 1
var2
```

## Results

As expected: There is **no difference**. knit creates new (empty) environment, runs all chunks and knit them.

## Next question

Is this the same with a `learnr` document?
